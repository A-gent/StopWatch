A small, customizable, portable stopwatch utility; can be compiled with AHKcompiler into an entirely portable binary executable.

<br >
-INSTALLATION- <br > <br >
Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/A-gent/StopWatch/releases), then download both the settings.cfg and the Stopwatch_edit.ahk files and put them wherever you like. Its recommended to put them in their own folder so you can better keep track of things though. <br > Then, if you don't already have it installed, install [Autohotkey v1.1 from here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe). <br > You can compile this into a .exe file for use without AHK installed as well, or simply download the .exe instead of the .ahk file on the releases page. You will also need the settings.cfg either way you go, for now.

NOTE: For customizing the start toggle / reset button hotkeys in the settings.cfg, [here's a list of acceptable keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/KeyList.htm)
